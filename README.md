# NCEAHelp Worker

This repo contains the code for the NCEAHelp Discord bot. It runs serverlessly in a Cloudflare Worker, and is written primarily in TypeScript. 

> This project's main developments occurred in [CyberFlameGO/NCEAHelpWorker_fork](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/NCEAHelpWorker_fork) until commit 20dde5113aefb2ceb5ff73543f7d9686291f2f41 (20dde51) - pull requests prior to/including that commit can be found in that old fork repository. The project was moved to a new repository to create a new repository network, and remove the limitations present that are encountered with repository forks - the code has changed substantially enough to justify such a move.
